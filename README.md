# HOW TO RUN IT ? 

### it's simple ! 

first, **clone** this repo (idk why i tell this, it's normal, but, anyway) :

`git clone https://github.com/ssbagpcm/image-to-3D-.SSBAGPCM.git`
 then : 
`cd image-to-3D-.SSBAGPCM`

secondly, we will install package and the main piece of the repository, **the ai** : 
 so : 

`python3 main.py` (this will **not** destroy your computer, don't worry, or report me if it do that..)

**when done** you will probably get a **success message**, if not, ask ai, or idk.

last step choose one of these great images : 

**forest.jpg** the best looking in my opinion :
![forest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb4ece47-4ab1-46cc-8b92-b7c2eee0f0b1)

**image.jpg** not the best ig : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35bb506b-59c0-4326-aa45-ae2f035ab98b)

**mountain.jpg** really bad, real talks 

![mountain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c5ba1f-9962-4072-9d23-8695a76c74fb)

**space.jpg** why not ðŸ¤”

## when you find the one you prefer lets create a .ssbagpcm (with all needed assets with it) 

**lets start**, right ? : 

`python3 server.py forest.jpg` (i took my favorite but replace 'forest.jpg', by the one you wanna see in 3D)

this will, **depend on your hardware**, take a bit of time (on my 8 gigs ram laptopt it's ~60 seconds), **generate a forest.ssbagpcm** file (for my example, always). 

# IF NO ERRORS, THEN YOU'LL START THE LAST STEP (...if not you prob' missed a step so go ahead and retry)
so : 

`python3 server.py --runserver`

***this will create a web server, with a nice ui, at http://127.0.0.1:8765/***

click on it and once the tab is opened, choose with your file manager the created file, by clicking on the 'Open .ssbagpcm' button, with the .ssbagpcm extension.

## see the lagic happen ! (if of course, working for you ðŸ˜¢)
have **fun** !

PS : dont avoid to dm me on discord i'd like to hang out about sciences, ai, maths, tech or anything. :)
